Welcome to the open source code for https://mamok.in!

This website is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

## Portfolio

Over time, this website will change, grow, get facelifts, and likely be re-written. THe purpose to mamok.in is a single location to share my skillset, provide quick links to projects I have worked on, proof-of-concept [demo applications](https://github.com/mamokin/site-mamokin/tree/develop/src/pages/Apps), and social links. 

As the site grows, new features will be added but with caution, after all this is a portfolio site. For more socially engaging elements or for discussions, please reach out to me via the provided social media links or read some articles on my [blog (WIP)](https://blog.mamok.in/).
